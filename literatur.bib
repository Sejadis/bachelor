    abstract = {We describe a new problem solver called STRIPS that attempts to find a sequence of operators in a space of world models to transform a given initial world model in which a given goal formula can be proven to be true. STRIPS represents a world model as an arbitrary collection in first-order predicate calculus formulas and is designed to work with models consisting of large numbers of formula. It employs a resolution theorem prover to answer questions of particular models and uses means-ends analysis to guide it to the desired goal-satisfying model.}

for computer games. Their application has been proposed to increase
modularity of an unmanned aerial vehicle’s control system. This paper
first describes advantages of behavior trees for use in mission management.
The paper then points out research towards their deployment. Finally,
newly developed transient tasks are introduced to behavior trees.
These allow for finite-state-machine-like initialization and interruption
of tasks. The use of the system is demonstrated with an unmanned
aircraft mission simulation.},

    abstract="Planning systems for real-world applications need the ability to handle concurrency and numeric fluents. Nevertheless, the predominant approach to cope with concurrency followed by the most successful participants in the latest International Planning Competitions (IPC) is still to find a sequential plan that is rescheduled in a post-processing step.We present Temporal Fast Downward (TFD), a planning system for temporal problems that is capable of finding low-makespan plans by performing a heuristic search in a temporal search space.We show how the context-enhanced additive heuristic can be successfully used for temporal planning and how it can be extended to numeric fluents. TFD often produces plans of high quality and, evaluated according to the rating scheme of the last IPC, outperforms all state-of-the-art temporal planning systems.",
